I've created a PowerShell script that will import your previously exported Citrix PVS configuration. This script is designed to work with the export script I provided earlier.
Features:

Parameterized execution - You can specify the import path and control behavior:
powershellCopy.\Import-PVSConfig.ps1 -ImportPath "C:\PVSExport\20250315_123456" -ForceOverwrite -SkipConfirmation

Comprehensive logging - Detailed logs are saved to track the import process
Dependency-aware import order - Components are imported in the correct sequence:

Farm configuration
Sites
Stores
Servers
Collections
vDisks (metadata)
Devices
Site Views
Farm Views
Authentication Groups


Conflict resolution - Options to handle existing items:

-ForceOverwrite to update existing items
-SkipConfirmation to bypass prompts


Detailed error handling - Each component's import is isolated to prevent failures from stopping the entire process

Important Notes:

The script only imports configuration metadata; vDisk files must already exist in the appropriate store paths
The script should be run on a server with the PVS Console installed
Some operations may require elevated permissions
For remote servers, the script will identify which can be added (current server only)

Save this script as Import-PVSConfig.ps1 and run it with the appropriate parameters to restore your PVS configuration.
