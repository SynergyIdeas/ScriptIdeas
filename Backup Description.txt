WEMData Backup Script - Description
This PowerShell script provides intelligent, automated backup monitoring for your D:\WEMData folder. Here's what it does:
Core Functionality
🔍 Smart Change Detection

Monitors the entire D:\WEMData folder and all subfolders
Creates a unique "fingerprint" of your data using file paths, sizes, and modification times
Only creates backups when actual changes occur - no unnecessary backups

📦 Automated Backup Creation

Creates timestamped ZIP files like WEMData_Backup_20250522_143022.zip
Stores backups in D:\Backup\WEMDataBackup\
Creates directories automatically if they don't exist

🧹 Automatic Housekeeping

Keeps only the 10 most recent backups
Automatically deletes older backup files to save disk space
Maintains organized backup history

📊 Comprehensive Logging

Logs all activities to D:\Logs\WEMBackup\
Daily log files with timestamps for easy troubleshooting
Tracks: Changes detected, backups created, files cleaned up, errors

How It Works
First Run:

Scans D:\WEMData and creates initial fingerprint
Creates first backup ZIP file
Saves fingerprint to D:\Backup\WEMDataBackup\WEMData_BackupState.txt

Subsequent Runs:

Scans current folder state and creates new fingerprint
Compares with saved fingerprint
If identical: Logs "No changes detected" and exits
If different: Creates new backup, updates fingerprint, cleans old backups

Change Detection Triggers:

Files added, deleted, or modified
File size changes
File timestamp changes
Folder structure changes

Perfect for Scheduled Tasks

Run every few hours without creating unnecessary backups
Efficient - only uses resources when changes actually occur
Self-managing - handles all cleanup and organization automatically
Reliable - won't miss changes or create false backups

This script essentially gives you "set it and forget it" backup monitoring - it watches your data 24/7 and only acts when something actually changes, keeping everything organized and manageable automatically.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
